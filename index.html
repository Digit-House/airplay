            WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY CLAIM FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE,
            ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY VIOLATION BY YOU OF ANY FEDERAL,
            STATE, OR LOCAL LAWS, STATUTES, RULES, OR REGULATIONS, EVEN IF
            COMPANY HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
            DAMAGE. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, IF THERE IS LIABILITY FOUND ON
            THE PART OF COMPANY, IT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE
            PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THERE BE
            CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE
            EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
            DAMAGES, SO THE PRIOR LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
          </p>
          <p>16. <b>Termination</b></p>
          <p>
            We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service
            immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole
            discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation,
            including but not limited to a breach of Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue
            using Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive
            termination shall survive termination, including, without
            limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity
            and limitations of liability.
          </p>
          <p>17. <b>Governing Law</b></p>
          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
            laws of Thailand, which governing law applies to agreement without
            regard to its conflict of law provisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
            not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of
            these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These
            Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our
            Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have
            had between us regarding Service.
          </p>
          <p>18. <b>Changes To Service</b></p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any
            service or material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion
            without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any
            part of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From
            time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or
            the entire Service, to users, including registered users.
          </p>
          <p>19. <b>Amendments To Terms</b></p>
          <p>
            We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this
            site. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised
            Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are
            expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any
            changes, as they are binding on you.
          </p>
          <p>
            By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions
            become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you
            do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use
            Service.
          </p>
          <p>20. <b>Waiver And Severability</b></p>
          <p>
            No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms
            shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or
            condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
            failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall
            not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
            competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for
            any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the
            minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will
            continue in full force and effect.
          </p>
